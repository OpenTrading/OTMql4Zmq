Date:   Fri May 8 16:41:34 2015 +0300

    Refactored the PyZmq to be more like OTMql4ZMQP.
    It's working fine for Mt4 sending tick, bar and timer events.
    Added a script bin/OTZmqPublish.py to test publishing messages
    back to PyZmq Mt4 - not working yet.

    Moved MQL4/Include/OTMql4/OTZmqBarInfo.mqh to

Date:   Thu Apr 23 17:00:42 2015 +0300

    Refactored OTLibProcessCmd.mqh into OTLibMt4ProcessCmd.mqh
    and OTZmqProcessCmd.mqh to make it easier for people to reuse
    ProcessCmd with the OT additions, and to extend it to handle
    their own additions.

    socket to get information from Metatrader is a REQ/REP socket.

Date:   Fri Apr 17 21:14:51 2015 +0300

    Rebased the source code on github.com/ungratefulson/mql4zmq/
    to move the Zmq version up to 4.0.4 - the src changes are trivial.
    
    Used his pre-compiled binaries for now - we'll recompile them
    ourselves as soon as time permits.
    
    Added a copy of our starting point to net/Git/github.com/ungratefulson
    so that we have an explicit version of ur starting point.
