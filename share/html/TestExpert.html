<h2>Test Expert</h2>

<p>There are two test expert advisors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>one for the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq:<a href="MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTZmqCmdEA.mq4">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTZmqCmdEA.mq4</a>We are having <strong>big</strong> problems with the receiving of messages by Mt4; sendingmessages from Mt4 is fine. See:<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1</a> and <a href="CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq.html">CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq</a>.<strong>In summary, the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq is usable only 1 way for now</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>one for the Python <a href="PyZmq.html">PyZmq</a>:<a href="MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4</a>See <a href="PythonOTMql4Zmq.html">PythonOTMql4Zmq</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>During debugging, we have had cases with the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq of<br />
the expert not being able to be removed: this is not normally the case,<br />
only when we have bad code.</p>

<p>If this happens, it may precent Mt4 from exiting cleanly.  If so, you<br />
must kill Mt4, and then manually edit the profile for that chart to<br />
remove the expert. Go to the <img src="{profile" title="{profile" alt="{profile" /> directory of your Mt4<br />
installation and read the file <tt>lastprofile.ini</tt> to find out what<br />
profile you are currently using. Then go into that directory and<br />
search the <tt>chr</tt> files for the ones that contain an <tt>&lt;expert&gt;</tt><br />
section. Remove the section that starts with <tt>&lt;expert&gt;</tt> and ends with<br />
<tt>&lt;/expert&gt;</tt>, inclusive.  Also remove any backup files your editor might make.<br />
Then restart Mt4.</p>
