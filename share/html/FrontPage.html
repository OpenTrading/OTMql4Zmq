<p>OTMql4Zmq - MQL4 bindings for ZeroMQ, the high-speed messaging protocol<br />
for asynchronous communications between financial and trading applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/</a></p>

<p>With ZeroMQ (http://zeromq.org/) you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Connect your code in any language, on any platform.</li>
	<li>Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, multicast.</li>
	<li>Smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull, and router-dealer.</li>
	<li>High-speed asynchronous I/O engines, in a tiny library.</li>
	<li>Backed by a large and active open source community.</li>
	<li>Supports every modern language and platform.</li>
	<li>Build any architecture: centralized, distributed, small, or large.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways of using ZeroMq via in this package:</p>

<p>1. Directly using a compiled DLL. We using ZeroMQ v2.2.0 to compile against,<br />
   but you should be able to connect to it from any more recent version.  See<br />
   <a href="CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq</a> .</p>

<p>2. Through <a href="PyZmq">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq</a><br />
   in Python under Metatrader using <br />
   <a href="OTMql4Py">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py</a> .<br />
   This is slower, but gives you all of Python under Mt4.</p>

<p>In general, you can use any version of ZeroMQ later than v2.2.0 to<br />
communicate with the either way of using ZeroMq, , so for example you can<br />
use the latest <a href="PyZmq">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq</a><br />
for client scripts talking to an EA that uses the compiled DLL:<br />
see <a href="Scripts">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/Scripts</a> .</p>

<p>You may also want to look at our RabbitMQ solution, which is a pure<br />
Python solution also using OTMql4Py:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/</a></p>

<p>You may want to also look at:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader</a><br />
which provides a command-line interpreter to speak to the OTMql4AMQP<br />
or OTMql4Zmq enabled Metatrader (either version).<br />
Most of our testing of this package is done from OpenTrader.</p>

<h3>Pre-Release</h3>

<p><strong>This is a work in progress - a developers' pre-release version.</strong></p>

<p>OTMql4Zmq works with Metatrader on builds &gt; 6xx, but it still needs<br />
testing on different versions of Windows and Mt4.</p>

<p>The source code for the Compiled DLL has been moved to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/</a><br />
to better document the changes we made in it from the original source.<br />
As a convenience, we have checked in the binaries from that project<br />
to the <tt>src/mql4zmq</tt> directory. In theory the files in this project<br />
will always mirror that project, but that project may get broken as we<br />
try to move it to compiling against ZeroMQ 4.x. If anyone is good at MSVC<br />
and ZeroMQ, if you could look at the code in that project and help us with<br />
ZeroMQ 4.x version improvements, we'd be grateful.</p>

<p>The project wiki should be open for editing by anyone logged into GitHub:<br />
**Please report any system it works or doesn't work on in the wiki:<br />
include the Metatrader build number, the origin of the metatrader exe,<br />
the Windows version, and the ZeroMq version and version of the Python pyzmq.**<br />
This code in known to run under Linux Wine (1.7.x), so this project<br />
bridges Metatrader to ZeroMq under Linux.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>For the moment there is no installer: just "git clone" or download the<br />
zip from github.com and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy<br />
the folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation. It will<br />
not overwrite any system files, and keeps its files in subdirectories<br />
called <tt>OTMql4</tt>.</p>

<p>For the Compiled DLL, see<br />
<a href="Installation">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/Installation</a> .</p>

<p>See <a href="PyZmq">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq</a><br />
for instructions for installing <img src="{pyzmq" title="{pyzmq" alt="{pyzmq" /> into your Python. You will need<br />
to run the Python <tt>OTZmqCmdEA.mq4</tt>, or to run the<br />
<a href="Scripts">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/Scripts</a> .<br />
in the <tt>bin</tt> directory.</p>

<h4>Dependencies</h4>

<p>You will need the Microsoft Visual C version 10.0 (2010) runtime<br />
libraries installed. On some versions of Windows, these may already be<br />
installed, or other software may already have installed these for you.<br />
You can get the VC 10.0 Runtime from the links below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84&amp;displaylang=en</a>    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555</a></li>

</ul>
<p>These are required to be able to load the <tt>libxmq.dll</tt> as it was<br />
compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.</p>
