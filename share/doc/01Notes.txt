## OTMql4Zmq Notes

### Problems

We are having problems with the receiving of messages with the
compiled DLL: the messages get received, but shortly afterwards,
Mt4 crashes. If you have success, please report any system it works
or doesn't work on in the wiki: include the Metatrader build number,
the origin of the metatrader exe, the Windows version.

### Compiled DLL Changes

The source checked in to the `src/` directory is from:
`git clone -b MQ_610_ZMQ_4 --single-branch https://github.com/ungratefulson/mql4zmq`

This has the very simple changes needed to run against ZeroMQ 4.0.x.
We deleted the `.mqh` file, as that was not updated for Build 600,
and is replaced with our version in the `MQL4/Include/OTMql4` directory.

We also deleted the `examples/` directory as we will have new Python
scripts in `bin/` and those examples do not use our nomenclature.

### Using PyZmq

The PyZmq expert cand code requires the OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/
with `pyzmq` installed in it (see below).
The Metatrader-Python bridge also requires the OpenTrading  Library:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/
For example of using `pyzmq` instead of the compiled DLL, see
`MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4`
